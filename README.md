# SparkBox Pokedex

### 3rd Party Tools Utilized

* [Next.js Framework](https://nextjs.org/) - Adds SSR and easy routing
* [Bootstrap ToolKit](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Simple CSS Framework
* [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) - Scoped CSS (as opposed to using BEM or Styled JSX)
* [Classnames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames) - A simple javascript utility for conditionally joining classNames together
* [React Icons](https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons) - SVG Icons

### Coding Decisions Made

* Utilize Aliases for calling files within the project. This prevents long directory imports.
* Utilize CSS Modules with SASS implemtation

### Building the App
`npm install`

### Running the App:

`npm start` Starts the development server. (Usually is `npm dev`)
